# Overview

This is a profile maker inspired by [Aiza Belle's Stardew Valley OC Profile Maker](https://www.lifeaftergrind.com/2023/08/stardew-valley-oc-profile-maker.html). Create your own character page as it would appear in [Fields of Mistria](https://www.fieldsofmistria.com/)!

# Instructions

Click on the profile or any of the liked or loved items to upload your own image. You can download game sprites from the [Fields of Mistria Wiki](https://fieldsofmistria.wiki.gg/wiki/Fields_of_Mistria_Wiki). (Tip: If you want to follow in-game design rules, arrange your likes and loves in alpahebtical order.) When you're done, you can download a .png of your profile using the link at the bottom of the page.

# Portraits
There's no Fields of Mistria portrait maker (yet!). Consider using the [Stardew Valley Portrait Maker](https://jazzybee.itch.io/sdvcharactercreator), or comissioning an artist. You can also edit existing character sprites from the game following the instructions from [this tutorial](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3305826941).

# Font

I recreated the Fields of Mistria font using FontStruct. You can download it from FontStruct [here](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2611132/fields-of-mistria) or downlaod `mistria.ttf` from this project.
