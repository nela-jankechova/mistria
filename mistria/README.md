# Overview

This is a profile maker inspired by [Aiza Belle's Stardew Valley OC Profile Maker] (https://www.lifeaftergrind.com/2023/08/stardew-valley-oc-profile-maker.html).

# Instructions

Click on the profile or any of the liked or loved items to upload your own image. You can download game sprites from the [Fields of Mistria Wiki] (https://fieldsofmistria.wiki.gg/wiki/Fields_of_Mistria_Wiki). (Tip: If you want to follow in-game design rules, arrange your likes and loves in alpahebtical order.) When you're done, you can download a .png of your profile using the link at the bottom of the page.

# Font

I recreated the Fields of Mistria font using FontStruct. You can download it from FontStruct [here](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2611132/fields-of-mistria) or downlaod `mistria.ttf` from this project.
